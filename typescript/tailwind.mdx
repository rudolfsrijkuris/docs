<Note>
    For styling ExpoShip uses Nativewind library which is wrapper for Tailwind CSS so it works in the same way.

## Dark mode support
To support dark mode you need to use following syntax in your code:

```ts example.tsx
className="text-white dark:text-black"
```

This will set text color to white in light mode and black in dark mode.

<Tip>
	You can use any styling and to add dark mode support just add `dark:` prefix. That's it!
