## Folder structure
### 1. `/app`
**All app screens** are under the `/app` folder, including:
- `/app/index.js`: **Main entry point** for the app. It redirects to the `SplashScreen`.
- `/app/_layout.js`: **Main layout** for the app. It wraps the app with `ThemeProvider` and `GestureHandlerView`.
- `/app/Splashscreen`: All the **splash screen** related files are under this folder.
- `/app/Onboarding`: All the **onboarding** related files are under this folder.
- `/app/Auth`: All the **authentication** related files are under this folder.
- `/app/Screens`: All the **component screens** from Home page are under this folder.
- `/app/(tabs)`: All the **tab screens** are under this folder (`Home`, `Ads`, `Settings`).

### 2. `/components`
**Reusable components** are under the `/components` folder. These components are used across the app.
